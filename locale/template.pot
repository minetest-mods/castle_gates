msgid ""
"Gates are multi-node constructions, usually (though not always) consisting "
"of multiple node types that fit together into a unified whole. The "
"orientation of gate nodes is significant, so a screwdriver will be a helpful "
"tool when constructing gates.\n"
"\n"
"A gate's extent is determined by a \"flood fill\" operation. When you "
"trigger a gate block, all compatible neighboring blocks will be considered "
"part of the same structure and will move in unison. Only gate blocks that "
"are aligned with each other will be considered part of the same gate. If you "
"wish to build adjoining gates (for example, a large pair of double doors "
"that meet in the center) you'll need to make use of gate edge blocks to "
"prevent it all from being considered one big door. Note that if your gate "
"does not abut any other gates you don't actually need to define its edges "
"this way - you don't have to use edge blocks in this case.\n"
"\n"
"If a gate has no hinge nodes it will be considered a sliding gate. When "
"triggered, the gate code will search for a direction that the gate can slide "
"in and will move it in that direction at a rate of one block-length per "
"second. Once it reaches an obstruction it will stop, and when triggered "
"again it will try sliding in the opposite direction.\n"
"\n"
"If a gate has hinge nodes then triggering it will cause the gate to try "
"swinging around the hinge. If the gate has multiple hinges and they don't "
"line up properly the gate will be unable to move. Note that the gate can "
"only exist in 90-degree increments of orientation, but the gate still looks "
"for obstructions in the region it is swinging through and will not swing if "
"there's something in the way."
